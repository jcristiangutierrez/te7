  <p>For this project I am looking into having animation as a source of interaction on my site. I am also looking at giving the ability to the user the ability to navigate in a 3D space. My overall idea for this project is to emulate a Galaxy.
		 In where the user can click on various pages and be in a space where you can see the orbiting planet and surrounding stars (if possible). </p>

<br>
<p>Some of the libraries that I looked at from the list were three,js. I really like the idea of <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene">three.js</a>,  in creating a <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_camera">3D</a> space where you can animate and mess with camera perspective.   </p>

	<p>Another example that I looked at was <a href= "https://github.com/FreddieRa/p5.3D">p5.3D.js</a>. I really liked the example but kind of found it hard to understand. And the 3D element of it was mostly based for <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/674191">text</a> and image which drew me away because I wanted to incorporate objects.
